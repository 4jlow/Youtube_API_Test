# Youtube_API_Test
Testing how to pull data from Youtube's API in R, followed by some basic data manipulation

Came across the youtuber nikocado avocado on youtube recommendations and noticed that alot of his videos had him slurping down some form of cheesy noodles.
Out of interest + wanting to test out youtube's API, I pulled the data and performed a simple linear regression on video title terms to see how they correlated 
with total youtube views.
Overall, there were insufficient occurences + a tonne of confounding variables that lead to insignificant results. Howeever, it was interesting to see that 
healthy food terms typically had a negative effect on the viewcount.
